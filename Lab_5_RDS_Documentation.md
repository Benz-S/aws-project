# Lab 5 Documentation: Build Your DB Server and Interact With Your DB Using an App

## üìÖ Lab Overview

This lab focused on using **Amazon RDS** to deploy a **MySQL** database instance and connect it to a web application hosted on an EC2 instance. The key concepts included launching an RDS instance with high availability, setting up proper networking and security configurations, and verifying database interaction via a browser-based app.

## üìä Objectives Completed

- Created an **Amazon RDS DB instance**
- Created and applied a **security group** to allow connections from the web server
- Created a **DB subnet group** with subnets in two availability zones
- Interacted with the database via a **web application**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Mistakes & Fixes

| Step | Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RDS Setup | Forgot to uncheck **Enhanced Monitoring** | Received IAM error, went back and unchecked it |
| Security Group | Used 0.0.0.0/0 instead of Web Security Group | Edited rule to manually select Web Security Group |
| Web App Config | Wrong endpoint pasted | Double-checked and replaced with correct RDS value |
